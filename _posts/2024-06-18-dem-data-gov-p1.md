What is Data Governance? Why is it of strategic importance? And What all have we got in our toolkit to address this. Welcome to the Data Governace blogs, let's explore this together.

##### Why does data/information need to be governed?

Imagine you're at Toronto's Reference liabrary & you are there for the first time. As a visitor, you would expect liabrary to have processes in place to onboard you and provide you best experience to access books / other services seemlessly. What it would take to provide you this? What if all books are cluttered all over & there is no clear record of what is kept where. You get the point!

In the realm of modern businesses, Data is the essential lifeline. Turning information into actionable insights and providing direction in a complex landscape enables leaders to make informed decisions, optimize operations, and anticipate market trends. Furthermore, data helps in tracking performance metrics, ensuring compliance with regulations, and fostering innovation.

##### What is Data Governance?

As defined by Collibra - "[Data governance](https://www.collibra.com/us/en/blog/what-is-data-governance#:~:text=Data%20governance%20is%20the%20practice%20of%20managing%20and,assets%20even%20under%20constraints%20for%20security%20and%20privacy. "Data governance") is the practice of managing and organizing data and processes to enable collaboration and compliant access to data. Data governance allows users to create value from data assets even under constraints for security and privacy."

According to the Data Management Body of Knowledge (DMBOK), the Aiken Pyramid illustrates fundamental Data Strategy principles and demonstrates how these elements are interconnected. At its base, the pyramid includes Data Governance, Data Quality, and Data Architecture, which are essential for the effectiveness of any data-driven initiative. These foundational areas establish the infrastructure needed to underpin other critical Data Management functions such as Data Modeling, Master & Reference Data Management, and Data Warehousing & Business Intelligence.

##### Evolution to Modern Data Governance

Due to the absence of a standardized definition and the historical tendency to confine data governance within IT, organizations have often held divergent views on its meaning, even among different departments. This lack of consensus across departments has contributed significantly to the historical shortcomings of data governance efforts.

Data Governance 1.0 focused on data cataloging for search and discovery but often operated in isolation within IT departments. Without input from key stakeholders across the organization, such as data managers and analysts, these initiatives struggled with issues like data duplications and poor quality. As a result, they frequently failed to sustain momentum and meet regulatory compliance needs in today's continuous data-driven business environment.

Organizations should move beyond data cataloging and compliance as primary goals for data governance. In the era of data-driven business, adopting a Data Governance 2.0 strategy involves making it a cross-functional initiative beyond IT. This approach ensures that stakeholders across the organization contribute to and benefit from governance efforts, enhancing data accuracy, consistency, and context. This holistic approach not only improves regulatory compliance but also enhances customer profiling and satisfaction while reducing the risk of data breaches.
