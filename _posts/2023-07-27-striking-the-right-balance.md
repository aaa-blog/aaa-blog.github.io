  A discovery itself is not moral, it's our application of it that has to pass the test. -Neil DeGrasse Tyson

Yes, No ... can be or it depends? Does it depend on which side are we on beneficiery or someone who has become victim. Is it based on the attitude or a view point of seeing glass "half empty vs half full".

It is very important question which should be asked with every major advancement of technology. Knowledge itself is not inherently good or bad; it is neutral. However, how knowledge is acquired, used, and the intentions behind its application can determine whether it has positive or negative consequences.

Responsible use of knowledge, ethical considerations, and a balanced approach to decision-making can help ensure that knowledge is used for the greater good and not to cause harm or perpetuate negative consequences.

##### Impact of AI :

Embracing AI and technological advancement offers a plethora of benefits. Some examples include increased efficiency, improved healthcare, better education, economic growth and many more areas it things to come. AI has made significant advancements in various areas in last few years & pace is astonishing.

Although, in real life this rapid technological advancement has made quite a lot of collateral damage. As Cathy O'Neil has detailed in her book, "Weapons of Math Destructions", these advancements can perpetuate inequality, reinforce biases, and harm individuals. AI models & advance algorithms have 3 main characteristics -

    1. Opacity: WMDs are often complex and hard to understand, leading to a lack of transparency in the decision-making process.

    2. Scale: These algorithms are applied on a massive scale, impacting thousands or millions of individuals simultaneously.

    3. Impact: WMDs can significantly affect people's lives, often perpetuating inequality and discrimination.

I will deep dive into some of the real-life examples in future. IT is a call to action for responsible and ethical use of mathematical models. 

##### Oppenheimer - Nuclear & AI parallel

Since, promotion of Christopher Nolan's bigraphical thriller film has began, it has brought lot of interest & awareness in the ethical question of scientific discovery of atomic bomb.

As it stands, both nuclear & AI are general purpose technologies. They have applications in both beneficial and harmful contexts. While AI has the potential to improve various industries, it also raises concerns about autonomous weapons and the misuse of personal data.

The development of nuclear weapons by Oppenheimer had a lasting impact on the world, shaping global politics and arms race dynamics. AI's continued advancement is projected to have a similarly profound and enduring impact on the future of humanity, as it becomes increasingly integrated into various aspects of society.
