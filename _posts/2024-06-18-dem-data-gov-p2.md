Does your organisation perform Data Governance? Is it applicable/required to all organisations? What should be strategy around the Data Governance initiative? Welcome to 2nd Data Governace blog in the series, to read previous click "[here](https://aaa-blog.github.io/intro/data%20governance/data/2024/06/18/dem-data-gov-p1/ "here").

##### Informal vs Formal Data Governance


All organizations need to be able to make decisions about how to manage data, realize value from it. They need a governance system that sets the rules of engagement for management activities.

Small organizations, or ones with simple data environments, may be able to succeed in these goals through an informal system of governance. They may not even be aware of when they are switching between making management decisions and broader governance decisions. On the other hand, larger organizations, or ones with more complex data or compliance environments, generally find that they need to step back and agree upon a more formal system of governance.


##### Data Governance Frameworks

A data governance framework is the collection of rules, processes, and role delegations that ensure privacy and compliance in an organization's enterprise data management. It is a logical structure for organizing how we think about and communicate Data Governance concepts.

One of the oldest framework is from Data Governance Institute depicted in below figure -

A Value-Driven Data Governance Program that employs the DGI Data Governance Framework begins with WHY: one or more Value Statements that are foundational to a program whose mission is to provide that value, in a recognizable and measurable manner, to the program’s beneficiaries.

Delivered value is realized through direct program outputs and by contributions to collaborative efforts that produce:

* Increased value from data assets and to assets, while also managing risk, via “little g” governance:
    * Data Products; Catalogs; Definitions; Metadata
    * Controls; Checkpoints; Measurements.
* Organizational Clarity, Efficiencies, and Effectiveness via “Big G” Governance outputs, such as
    * Decision Rights for Data; Data-Related Decisions
    * Accountabilities & Oversight Models
    * Policies and Rules; Guidance and Guardrails

Supported by processes, tools, and communications, the Data Governance Work Program is managed as a Portfolio of Activities, each with its own focus, scope, goals, metrics, lifecycle, and funding model.

A Data Governance Office (DGO) drives the work program. Other participants include decision-making councils, data stewards embedded in work program activities, and beneficiaries of the program who provide decision-makers and stewards.

###### Other Frameworks

Over the years, number of thought leaders have created & shared impeccable body of knowledge with practitioners. Few examples would be - [Non-Invasive Data Governance Framework](https://datagovernance.com/the-dgi-data-governance-framework/dgi-data-governance-framework-components/ "Non-Invasive Data Governance Framework") or the one from [NASCIO](https://datagovernance.com/the-dgi-data-governance-framework/dgi-data-governance-framework-components/ "NASCIO"). May be topic for blog for another day :)

###### We touched on important topic of strategy implementing DG program for enterprises formally. This is very essential step for long term success of the initiative. Frameworks gave us system of ideas for guiding subsequent analysis and decision making. We will explore technology platforms & operational aspects of DG.
