Which is the most used programming language in 2023? As per stackoverflow survey of professional developers, JavaScript takes the top spot followed by HTML/CSS & SQL. Why is SQL still featured on leaderboard? Let's explore more in this blog-

SQL (Structured Query Language) is a programming language used to communicate with and manipulate databases. To get the most of the mounds of data they collect, many businesses must become versed in SQL. Here’s everything you should know about using SQL to access and manipulate data.

##### What is SQL & when it is used?

Businesses and other organizations use SQL programs to access and manipulate the information and data in their databases and create and alter new tables. To fully understand SQL, you need to know exactly what a database is.

According to Microsoft, a database is a tool for collecting and organizing information. Databases can store information about people, products, orders or anything else. Many databases start in a word processing program or spreadsheet. As they get larger, many businesses find it helpful to transfer them to a database created by a database management system.

SQL helps control information stored in databases, allowing users to retrieve the specific data they’re looking for when they need it.

While it’s a simple programming language, SQL is very powerful. In fact, SQL can insert data into database tables, modify data in existing database tables and delete data from SQL database tables. In addition, SQL can modify the database structure itself by creating, modifying, and deleting tables and other database objects.

SQL uses a set of commands to manipulate the data in databases. Examples include SQL INSERT, which is used to add data to database tables; SQL SELECT, which retrieves data from database tables; and SQL UPDATE, which modifies existing database records.

##### SQL History :

The SQL programming language was developed in the 1970s by IBM researchers Raymond Boyce and Donald Chamberlin. The programming language, known then as SEQUEL, was created following Edgar Frank Codd’s paper, “A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks,” in 1970. They took Codd’s languages with the goal of designing a relational language that would be more accessible to users without a formal training in mathematics or computer science.

> When SQL was established in the early 70s, it was called SEQUEL (Structured English Query Language). However, due to a copyright issue, it was changed it to SQL. In fact, SQL is typically pronounced “sequel” today, but some favor the non-acronym pronunciation of “ess-cue-el”.

The original SQL version they designed was used to manipulate and retrieve data stored in IBM’s original relational database systems, known as “System R.” In the succeeding years, SQL was not publicly available. However, in 1979, Oracle, then known as Relational Software, released its own version of SQL called Oracle V2, which was commercially released. It is important to note that SQL wasn’t the first programming language for navigating databases, but it did cut an impeccable presence due to its intuitiveness, power, and reliability.

##### ANSI Standards :

In 1986, the SQL language became formally accepted, and the ANSI Database Technical Committee (ANSI X3H2) of the Accredited Standards Committee (ASC) X3 developed the first SQL standard, ANSI X3.135-1986. This was the beginning of what people mistakenly call the ANSI standard for SQL. In truth, there are no ANSI standards, only standards developed by ANSI-approved committees, many operating in accordance with the ANSI Essential Requirements (American National Standards). Within a few months, ISO published a technically identical standard, ISO 9075-1987, bringing SQL, which was once confined to IBM’s databases in its infancy, to the international stage.
